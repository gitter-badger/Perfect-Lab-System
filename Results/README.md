For the results folder, we designed this folder to only hold those finalized results for publications. Intermediate results such as analysis results should be placed in the Data folder which can auto-sync with server. 
In this folder, files such as MS Office can be uploaded if they are less than 50 MB.
However large files (such as videos and yamls) cannot be directly uploaded to GitHub. The corresponding link files would be uploaded as the Data and the Reference folder.

**Markdown is the suggested format to write documents (instead of Word and Excel files), Markdown can also be used to make slides. Checkout [here](https://gitpitch.com/). However I understand the transition is painful. But you can just spend 5 minutes to learn Markdown which might gain you a job in the future.**
