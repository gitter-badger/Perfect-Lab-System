For the References folder, all the references would be backed up in the server and automatically create links in the local folder (./links). You have the option to sync the reference folder with Nutstore or EndNote. 

**Please do not manually add any files except links to the ./links folder.**

There is a secret in the .gitignore file, can you find what it is?

If you need any help or have questions, please post an issue on [here](https://github.com/Wenlab/Template-Project-Repository/issues). I'd like to help you.

If necessary, I can add all markdown files in the links folder.
